dx11-3d-heightmap
=================

An open 3D Direct3D 11 world example that uses heightmaps.
This project may be used as an intro to D3D11 programming as it is limited to the "bare necessities". ;)
We use C++ and no explicit 3rd party library for that purpose.
Matrix arithmetics is done using xnamath.

A heightmap-loader (greyscale RAW pictures) as well as a shader-loader are included.



Controls:
W, A, S, D    move in the 3d world
Arrow         keys look around
M             toggle gravity
