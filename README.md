dx11-3d-heightmap
=================

An open 3D Direct3D 11 world example that uses heightmaps.
This project may be used as an intro to D3D11 programming as it is limited to the "bare necessities". ;)
We use C++ and no explicit 3rd party library for that purpose.
Matrix arithmetics is done using xnamath.

A heightmap-loader (greyscale RAW pictures) as well as a shader-loader are included.



Controls:
* W, A, S, D    move in the 3d world
* Arrow         keys look around
* M             toggle gravity



# Test the program
Download the file `Release/Michael Jakob - FinalOptimization.zip` and unzip it.
Within you will find a Microsoft executable file you can run.
Note that a **Direct3D 11** graphics card is required in order to properly use this application
